Enchanted - Taylor Swift

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,200
There I was again tonight

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,000
Forcing laughter, faking smiles

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,800
Same old tired, lonely place

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,600
Walls of insincerity

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,500
Shifting eyes and vacancy

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,100
Vanished when I saw your face

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:45,000
All I can say is it was
enchanting to meet you

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,000
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Across the room, your silhouette

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Starts to make its way to me

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,600
The playful conversation starts

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,600
Counter all your quick remarks

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,800
Like passing notes in secrecy

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:20,600
And it was enchanting to meet you

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:32,800
All I can say is I was
enchanted to meet you

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,600
This night is sparklin',
don't you let it go

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm wonderstruck, blushin'
all the way home

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,500
I'll spеnd forever wonderin'
if you knеw

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:02,500
I was enchanted to meet you

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
The lingering question kept me up

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
2AM, who do you love?

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,200
And now, I'm pacing back and forth

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,800
Wishing you were at my door

25
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,800
I'd open up and you would say

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:36,700
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:51,700
All I know is I was enchanted
to meet you

28
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,700
This night is sparklin',
don't you let it go

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm wonderstruck, blushin'
all the way home

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:14,200
I'll spend forever wonderin'
if you knew

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,200
This night is flawless,
don't you let it go

32
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm wonderstruck, dancing
around all alone

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,700
I'll spend forever wonderin'
if you knew

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:42,300
I was enchanted to meet you

35
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
This is me praying that

36
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
This was the very first page

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Not where the storyline ends

38
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,400
My thoughts will echo your name

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Until I see you again

40
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,300
These are the words I held back

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,300
As I was leaving too soon

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,700
I was enchanted to meet you

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,900
Please, don't be in love
with someone else

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,500
Please, don't have somebody
waitin' on you

45
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,500
Please, don't be in love
with someone else (Ooh)

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,100
Please, don't have somebody
waitin' on you (Oh-oh)

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,600
This night is sparklin',
don't you let it go

48
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm wonderstruck, blushin'
all the way home

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:10,900
I'll spend forever wonderin'
if you knew

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
This night is flawless (Please, don't
be in love with someone else)

51
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,200
Don't you let it go

52
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't
have somebody waitin' on you)

53
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Dancing around all alone

54
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,600
I'll spend forever (Please, don't
be in love with someone else)

55
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,800
Wonderin' if you knew

56
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,400
I was enchanted to meet you

57
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,900
Please, don't be in love
with someone else

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Please, don't have somebody
waitin' on you

59
